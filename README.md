SiriRemoteBTT with support for the new Siri Remote, now availabe

I just finished the first SiriRemoteBTT alpha with support for the new Apple TV Remote (Siri Remote) and BTT.

You can pair a Siri Remote with your Mac and configure some gestures or assign actions to it’s buttons.
Also, you can control your mouse using the remote’s trackpad

Needs Bluetooth 4.0 support
The remote’s trackpad goes to sleep after about a minute of not using it. It is reactivated by pressing any button, thus maybe keep one of the buttons unassigned and use it only to wake up the trackpad.

Just tested the SiriRemoteBTT with BTT and it is working very well.

You can download it [here](http://github.com/guileschool/SiriRemoteBTT/blob/master/SiriRemoteBTT.dmg)

The script file in the following path can be used to directly modify after installation
**"/Library/Application Support/SiriRemote/"**
